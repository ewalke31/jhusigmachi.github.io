		  <p>Why Go Greek?</p>
                    <p>Over the summer, I attended the Balfour Leadership Training Workshop at Ball State University (the Alma mater of David Letterman, who is a Sigma Chi) in Muncie, Indiana. It is a yearly conference held by Sigma Chi that hosts some hundred chapters, several thousand brothers, and boasts a number of workshops and networking opportunities. While there, I looked back on my days as a starry-eyed freshman who couldn't wait to go to his first "frat party," and wondered, "How did I get here?" If being in a fraternity - and going Greek in general - is about so much more than I thought, why did I even rush the first place, and more importantly, why did I stay?</p>
		    <p>As a freshman, I was unsure of whether or not I wanted to join a fraternity. I certainly wanted to make friends and have fun, but I had also heard the horror stories. Still, I decided "Why not?" And as I found out when I eventually pledged as a sophomore, pledging was anything but the terrible experience it had been made out to be. I also found the friends I had made were more than friends; they were brothers, tied to me for the rest of my life. So that's why I initially joined: friends, fun, and a promise I wouldn't be elephant-walking in a dark basement any time soon.</p>
		    <p>But then, come my junior year, I found myself on the other side of the process. I found people asking me why <i>they</i> should give Greek Life a chance, especially if they only thought fraternities and sororities stood for partying with friends, based on movies like <i>Neighbors</i>. But fraternities and sororities are not stereotypes, nor are the people in them. Some people aspire to be John "Bluto" Blutarsky, others don't even know what an "animal house" is, and often times, both are in the same fraternity. Contrary to popular belief, fraternities and sororities, on the whole, are about teaching you how to be upstanding men and women in society: courteous, intelligent, and above all else, <i>leaders</i>. Because fraternities and sororities are, at their heart, character-building institutions, and <i>that</i> is why I stayed.</p>

                    <p>In the classroom, I focus on developing my skills in mathematics and applying mathematical models to solve biological problems.</p>
                    <p>For the past two years, I have worked with Dr. Danielle Bassett of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Sarah Feldt Muldoon of the SUNY, Buffalo Campus. We are investigating new statistics for quantifying the small world tendencies of networks, with a focus on how this translates to biological systems. Our work thus far is summarized in our paper, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02194">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>For the past year, I have been working with <a href="http://jovo.me/"> Dr. Joshua Vogelstein</a> of <a href="http://neurodata.io">neurodata.io</a> to bring data-driven neuroscience into the scientific spotlight. Big data problems in neuroscience are highly computationally intensive, and require a high level of base knowledge to begin to tackle. The Neurodata team looks to simplify this process, by providing open source access to processing pipelines, all code, and preprocessed outputs. I am currently involved in the data processing segment of the project, investigating the reliability of fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging), two tools that will prove incredibly useful for connectomic research in the upcoming years.</p>

                    <p> Over the course of my life, I've developed an intense passion for music, sports, and the outdoors.</p>
                    <p> I currently play the electric guitar, and my interests are geared particularly towards late 70s and 80s rock. I like to think I have a favorite band for every mood; whether it's Metallica while working out or the Eagles while hanging out with friends, I can listen to pretty much anything across the spectrum as long as it has some solid guitar work. </p>
                    <p> In high school, I was an avid athlete, and I have tried to keep that up as much as possible. I am inseparable from my bike on and off campus, and love exploring somewhat precarious trails going at even more precarious speeds (at least I wear a helmet?). Being from Pennsylvania, I have essentially more nature at my disposal than I can possibly cover, so I'm always out hiking in the Poconos or rock climbing.</p>
